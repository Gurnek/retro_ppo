This is an implementation of the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm in PyTorch.
It is built using actor critic and it learns how to play in the Vizdoom environment. 
By default it plays in deadly corridor, although the model is too simple to actually
become proficient at playing, as I don't have the gpu power to train anything significant.
